# Custom functions

These are a few functions I wrote to help with some of the coding that we
have to do repeatedly.

The functions from this notebook can be imported into another notebook by
using the `%run` command in a code cell:

```
%run <path to notebook>
```

This will make the functions useable in the notebook.
